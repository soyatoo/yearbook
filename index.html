      <h2>What is the yearbook?</h2>
      <p>A collection of pictures and stories that showcase the year that was, something for us all to look back on and remember exactly what 2022 felt like.<p>
      <p>It's about seeing who was around and what we did, rather than amazing pics of people standing in tunnels (though a few of those do get in).</p>
      <h2>Deadline</h2>
      <p>Before 1st of Feb 2023.</p>
      <div class="chunk"></div>
      <h2>Picture checklist</h2>
      <p>- Visibly exploring related;</p>
      <p>- People in frame;</p>
      <p>- Faces unblurred (they'll be blurred on request but I like to make them all the same style!);</p>
      <p>- Taken between <strong>1st of Jan 2022 and 31st Dec 2022</strong>;</p>
      <p>- Photos you have personally taken! Or tell me who took it and I'll ask them if I can use it;</p>
      <p>- Phone / DSLR / Film photos are all fine, so long as they're not tiny resolution;</p>
      <div class="chunk"></div>
      <h2>Story checklist</h2>
      <p>- Exploring related;</p>
      <p>- No names or location details if it's particularly spicy;</p>
      <p>- If there are picture accompaniments to your story, send them in the place you think they'd best sit and we can workshop;</p>
      <h2>Where to send</h2>
      <p>By email: <a href="mailto:wasurechika@gmail.com">wasurechika@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p>Big files can be sent via <a href="https://wetransfer.com/">Wetransfer</a></p>
